  <p>Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>My name is Andy Qiao and I am a Junior in highschool. I'm taking this course because I want to gain experience in web development. </p>
    <p>I don't have much experience with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. I hope I can learn a lot in this course.</p>
